# Brewdrivers
This repository is one of a set of repositories in the Brewery Control System project of the Navasota Brewing Company. It contains low level drivers for devices we use in the brewing process.

Unless you're here looking to do some direct interaction with devices and RTUs, this probably isn't the best place to start. See the [organization's readme](https://github.com/NavasotaBrewing/readme) for more information.

# Usage
This is a Rust library, used by the other Rust crates in the organization. You can see the docs for this crate on docs.rs.
