# Brewdrivers
This project provides low level drivers for the hardware that the [Navasota Brewing Cooperative](https://navasotabrewing.com) uses on it's brewing rig. It serves as a back end to [brewkit](https://github.com/NavasotaBrewing/brewkit), a project that makes it easy to manage and control the brewing hardware. It's basically a small SCADA system. `Brewkit` is the web front-end with pretty graphics and nice things, `brewdrivers` is where all the low level drivers live.

~~To learn more about the code and how to use it, [read the documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/brewdrivers/)~~.

**Note:** all documentation has been removed. The code is changing so fast it's too hard to maintain. It's just confusing. Docs will be added later.

Small edit, ignore me please
